 * Dietary example of a linear programming(optimization) problem
 * Author - jordan vanevery
 * Assignment for CS362 @ the University of New Mexico

 * The problem concerns minimizing the cost of a diet from a selection of 
 * possible food items that meets the constraints of the RDA dietary standards 
 * for a human for one day. The pieces of the linear program are as follows:
 *
 *   Objective function = cost of food items
 *   Constraints = dietary requirements (2000 calories, etc.)
 *   Variables = number/amount of food items
